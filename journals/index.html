            <P>Before learning how to make a website, it's so easy to create one through subscription websites. Everything is set up for you, easy access, it's comforting. But this lacks personalization and has more of limitations since it's already designed. A website should present the website owner's personality, style, aesthetic, etc. 
            There's so many different types of websites in this world, I think its important for each website owners to showcase their own special website into the world. </P>

            <P>technology has become a significant part of everyone's lives, no matter the generation. It has become essential, and where it's difficult to be a part of society without it. Could this be an addiction or just normal?
            Technology is now used for comfort rather than just as a tool. There's a never-ending advancement throughout the years.
            What happened to looking at paper maps? Enjoying coffee, tea, biking, and walking rather than video games and social media. Reading the newspaper rather than reading news articles. Sending mails instead of text messaging. </p>

            <p>"The first computers were human...human computation" Humans being the most complicated, detailed, sensitive in this world. So many different aspects, personalizations, characteristics of a being. "Just like a painting, stepping inside the computer takes patience, but it may be easier than you think." this also applies to a human. Getting to know the person through time and patience. Being active in conversations, listening and understanding eachother helps to get closer. </p>

                <p> My first reaction to the website was frustrating and needed a lot of patience. Trying to wait or expect for something to apear, change, or even show any sort of instructions. I spent the most time clicking through and testing what happens next. I became more curious about the intent was and why certain content was designed this way.</p>

            <p> As I was listening to the audio, the sound progressively became more agressive and chaotic. I felt more confused and overwhelmed throughout the rest of the audio. In the website, we get to see some different types of handmade sites. Seeing the fluidity and variety of the compositions.Some sites are very simple while some are advanced/complicated. This shows a variety of different websites in our world.</p>
