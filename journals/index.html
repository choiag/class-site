            <P>Before learning how to make a website, it's so easy to create one through subscription websites. Everything is set up for you, easy access, it's comforting. But this lacks personalization and has more of limitations since it's already designed. A website should present the website owner's personality, style, aesthetic, etc. 
            There's so many different types of websites in this world, I think its important for each website owners to showcase their own special website into the world. </P>
        <P class="special">http://ursulakleguinarchive.com/Note-Technology.html:</P>
            <P>technology has become a significant part of everyone's lives, no matter the generation. It has become essential, and where it's difficult to be a part of society without it. Could this be an addiction or just normal?
            Technology is now used for comfort rather than just as a tool. There's a never-ending advancement throughout the years.
            What happened to looking at paper maps? Enjoying coffee, tea, biking, and walking rather than video games and social media. Reading the newspaper rather than reading news articles. Sending mails instead of text messaging. </p>

            <p>"The first computers were human...human computation" Humans being the most complicated, detailed, sensitive in this world. So many different aspects, personalizations, characteristics of a being. "Just like a painting, stepping inside the computer takes patience, but it may be easier than you think." this also applies to a human. Getting to know the person through time and patience. Being active in conversations, listening and understanding eachother helps to get closer. </p>
