        <p class="special">A little bit about me.<br>Hello! I am a 20 year old artist who loves to create artwork digitally and traditionally. I am currently a student studying Graphic Design.<br>Because I am a multi-media artist, I enjoy learning and exploring different mediums but also teaching and sharing what I am pursuing in. I have many interests in teaching fine arts, craft, design, etc. to young artists that want to experiment and discover their creativity and passion for art.<br>A little fact about me is that I love black coffee, which seems unlikely for a 20 year old but this is my most favorite drink. As a hobby, I love spending time exploring new cafes around me, experimenting new flavors and just enjoying the environment.<br>As always, I am open to opportunities for me to learn and grow my experience & knowledge, to help me expand the world through my creativity and passion. </p>
